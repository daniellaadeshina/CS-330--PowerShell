# CS-330--PowerShell
History and Getting Started: PowerShell

1. What is the name of your language?
The programming language I chose is PowerShell.
2. When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?
PowerShell was created by Microsoft in 2006. It was originally developed under the code name Monad by Jeffrey Snover, who was the lead architect. The main goal was to provide a more powerful and flexible command-line shell and scripting language for Windows systems. Before PowerShell, Windows administrators relied heavily on GUIs (graphical interfaces) or limited tools like Command Prompt. PowerShell solved this by letting administrators automate tasks, manage configurations, and control large numbers of computers efficiently.
3. What types of programming is your language primarily used for?
PowerShell is mainly used for:

System administration (managing Windows and, more recently, Linux/macOS systems).

Cybersecurity tasks (incident response, detecting suspicious processes, checking logs).

Automation (scheduling updates, monitoring servers, deploying software).

Cloud management (controlling Microsoft Azure environments).

Examples of projects:

Writing scripts that detect failed login attempts to identify possible brute force attacks.

Automating network configuration across hundreds of computers.

Managing Active Directory users and groups in corporate environments.
4. Where will you get information about this language when itâ€™s time to start programming in it?
I will use official documentation, online tutorials, and reference books. Here are some resources specific to PowerShell:
